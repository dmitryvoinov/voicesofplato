# Voices of Plato
Stylometry-driven research of Plato's dialogues

Do Plato's characters possess an individual style?
Can it be tracked both in early and late dialogues?
Are Socrates from the early works and Socrates from the later dialogues the same character stylometry-wise?

A study of Plato's dialogues in Ancient Greek will allow us to find answers to these questions.
In other words, to find out what the ‘voices of Plato’ actually sound like.

To do so we:
1. Study the existing research papers and works related to Plato, stylometry, and digital humanities.
2. Work with Plato's dialogues in XML (both English and Ancient Greek versions) making sure that the correct markup is there.
3. Conduct research via Stylo (R package) to analyze stylometry specifics of the dataset.
4. Make conclusions and think of further research possibilities.

These steps are described at https://dmitryvoinov.com/plato in detail.

CONTENTS:
1. LINK: landing page describing the project.
2. XMLs: a dataset of the three XMLs in the Ancient Greek
   - Charmides completed; 150 kb)
   - Phaedo (to be completed in 04-2024; 393 kb)
   - Symposium (completed; 268 kb)
4. Code 1: the solution that partially helped us to markup the 'Symposium' dialogue
5. Code 2: the solution that helped us to retrieve the necessary lines from the XMLs.
